      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">The Situation</h1>
      <p>The people of the Democratic Republic Of The Congo are being exploited. Citizens of all ages are being forced into dangerous caves in order to mine minerals. This includes women and children. They are paid next to nothing. 
          Miners have to dig in long and narrow holes in order to mine cobalt as well as copper. Furthermore, they all do it by hand without gloves or protective equipment. Not only are the miners negatively affected, people living in the general area are also being harmed. With a mass amount of mining comes pollution. This pollution has resulted in birth defects.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Who is Involved</h1>
      <p>One may ask why these companies need cobalt. Cobalt is used in lithium ion batteries. It is used in the cathode part of a battery and is necessary for its high energy levels. It can be sustainably charged and discharged over many cycles. It is also very safe because it can quickly oxidize which prevents excess oxygen from creating a fire hazard. Another big reason for its use is that it is cheap. Companies like Apple, Tesla, and Alphabet (which is a parent company of Google) all use The DRC for their cobalt need of lithium ion batteries. These companies have mainly refused responsibility for the DRCâ€™s atrocious mining conditions. Apple along with Google, Microsoft, Dell and Tesla were recently in a class action lawsuit due to injuries sustained in mineral mining of The DRC. This case was later dismissed due to lack of evidence for the conditions that caused the injuries.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Solutions</h1>
      <p>There are many steps that can be taken to combat this crisis. The Huge tech companies can pay the miners fairly for their work. They can also give the miners equipment. This would be mining equipment like hammers as well as pick axes. This would also be safety equipment like helmets and safety gloves. They also pay money directly to the government so that they can enforce laws of child employment or limiting work hours. Another way of changing this system is to mine a different resource. Manganese is a mineral that can be ethically mined and provides similar energy levels for a lower cost. How can we as a society push big tech companies to make this move? One way is to put your money where your mouth is. Boycott these companies until they change the way they get their minerals/resources. Vote for politicians willing to combat these companies and create restrictions.</p>
